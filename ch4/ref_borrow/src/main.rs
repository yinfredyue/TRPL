    // Restriction: you can have only one mutable reference to a particular 
    // piece of data in a particular scope.
    // This allows Rust prevent data race at compile time. Example:
    {
        let mut option = Some(5);
        let option_reference = &mut option;
        let mut backup = 0;
        let reference = match option_reference { // reference is a mutable ref
            &mut Some(ref mut n) => n,
            _ => &mut backup,
        };
        /* if the next line was allowed, what would be the result of the line after that? */
        // *option_reference = None;
        *reference = 10; // reference assumes it's a valid reference, but actually it's not
    }
    // In simple word, one mutable reference might invalidate the other.
    // 
    // Similarly, mutable refernece cannot exist with immutable reference in 
    // the same scope. Note that a referenceâ€™s scope starts from where it is 
    // introduced and continues through the last time that reference is USED.
    // This is ok:
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2); // r1 and r2 are no longer used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{}", r3);

    // Rust prevents dangling reference at compile time.
    
    // Reference rules:
    // 1. At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any 
    // number of immutable references.
    // 2. References must always be valid.
